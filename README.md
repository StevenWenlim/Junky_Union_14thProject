# Junky_Union_14thProject
Film Junky Union, a new community for classic film fans, is developing a system to filter and categorize film reviews. Their main mission is to train a model that can automatically detect negative reviews. I will be using the IMBD movie review dataset with polarity labeling to create a model that can classify reviews as positive or negative.
